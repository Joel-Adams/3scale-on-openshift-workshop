# 3scale-gateway-on-openshift-workshop
This workshop takes you through the steps to get the 3scale configured Nginx Gateway running on Openshift.

## Agenda

A rough agenda for the workshop looks like this:

Integrate this simple unmanaged API Endpoint into 3scale and deploy the previously configured Nginx gateway for this API, on Openshift.

(**Note, this is a test API on Heroku. The first time it is hit every hour is slow)


## Slides

The slides are written in [RevealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)/[Hyla](https://github.com/cmoulliard/hyla) which is basically a text (asciidoc) format and then converted into an HTML 5 slideshow presentation.

## Labs

The labs are written in [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) format (asciidoc) and can be viewed online or in offline book (pdf, epub, mobi) format. Each Gitbook has a [change request](https://help.gitbook.com/books/what-are-change-requests.html) process, and should have [integration with a Github repo](https://help.gitbook.com/github/can-i-host-on-github.html#github-integration) to allow changes to be sync'ed up between the two.
